        <h1>A DAY AT THE BEACH</h1>

        <p>The beach is the place I go to whenever I need to relax and forget about all the hustles of life and just enjoy myself. As usual, my last visit to there was a memorable one. Already in my beach attire, a draught blew across the sea sweeping away with it my spirit. The sun split its way through the scattered cumulus clouds as if it was shying away from giving some light. As I took in a breath of fresh air, my nose was tingled by the smell of the salty sea. A mine field of corals made up the beach sand, with an abundance of multicolored sea shells. A bed of blankets was however formed by the sand at the same time. Like my previous visit, this visit was promising to be one filled with immense joy and relaxation.
    
        My heart somehow pounded like a drum-set of an orchestra from the way the beach sand flowed onto my feet and tickled my toes. The feeling was delicate especially given that the sand grains were so fine it was almost impossible to see them through the human eye. The sea waves soothed me through a dulcet lullaby thus drawing me closer to them as I reminisced my childhood. It was like they were giving me an invitation with wide open arms. However, my feet would not oblige at this time because they were penetrated by the frigid waves. So, I just sat down with my head raised to the sky as I watched the sun stretch out and make its way across the sky.
            
        The warm sun rays gradually glowed as minutes passed by, reaching down to me and giving me a shining streak of light as if to tell me, “Hey, hold my hand!” I received an immediate boost of excitement as the blazing light pierced through my cold skin. Tracing its way up the sky, the sun distributed its light to everything it could lay its sight on. Birds flying across the sky trying to claim it for themselves were singing sweet melodies with high spirits into my ears. From the sun rays, the sky turned into an illuminated shimmering blue color from a dark misty indigo one. The scattered rainless clouds that were initially blocking sun rays melted away into thin air and gave way for the water to heat up.
            
        I slowly made my way to the edge of the beach once again and immersed my toe into the now swiftly heating up water. I hastily withdrew it as it felt like it was melting away into the sea in spite of having been numb before. The pungent smell that came from decayed algae filled the air and my acidic stomach responded by turning to its side. I could hear the sounds of fish that were possibly calling for attention from under the sea. I could at the same time tell that the fish were afraid of the sea creatures that were hungrily preying on smaller water creatures for lunch. This was a survival tactic, I could tell.
            
        As the evening was drawing, people poured onto the beach to enjoy the serenity and perfect weather. Children ran up and down as laughter filled up every corner of the beach and people even played beach football and volleyball. The day was finally coming to an end and one by one, people started leaving slowly after what had been a day full of excitement. It was unfortunate that as much as I had wanted to continue staying on the beach and continue undergoing this memorable experience, my turn to go home finally came. I left with a heart filled with happiness and peace and a tired body and promised myself that I would go back there as many times as I would be able to.
